# AtliQ Tees: Talk to a Database  

This is an end to end LLM project based on Gemini and Langchain. We are building a system that can talk to MySQL database. 
User asks questions in a natural language and the system generates answers by converting those questions to an SQL query and
then executing that query on MySQL database. 
AtliQ Tees is a T-shirt store where they maintain their inventory, sales and discounts data in MySQL database. A store manager 
will may ask questions such as,
- How many white color Adidas t shirts do we have left in the stock?
- How much sales our store will generate if we can sell all extra-small size t shirts after applying discounts?
The system is intelligent enough to generate accurate queries for given question and execute them on MySQL database

## Project Highlights

- AtliQ Tees is a t shirt store that sells Adidas, Nike, Van Heusen and Levi's t shirts 
- Their inventory, sales and discounts data is stored in a MySQL database
- We will build an LLM based question and answer system that will use following,
  - Gemini LLM
  - Agents
  - Streamlit for UI
  - Langchain framework
  - Chromadb as a vector store
- In the UI, store manager will ask questions in a natural language and it will produce the answers

  
## Project Structure

- main.py: The main Streamlit application script.
- code.py: This has all the langchain code
- requirements.txt: A list of required Python packages for the project.
- .env: Configuration file for storing your Google API key.
